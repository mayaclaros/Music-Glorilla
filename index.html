        <h2>Why Glorilla</h2>
        <h3>Why is Glorilla the best?</h3>
        <p>Gloria Hallelujah Woods[1] (born July 28, 1999), known professionally as GloRilla, is an American rapper and songwriter from Memphis, Tennessee. She first became known for her 2022 single "F.N.F. (Let's Go)" (with Hitkidd), which peaked within the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Rap Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards. Its success led her to sign with fellow Memphis rapper Yo Gotti's record label, Collective Music Group, in July of that year.

Her follow-up single, "Tomorrow", spawned a remixed sequel with American rapper Cardi B, which became her first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Both songs, along with the gold-certified single "Blessed", preceded the release of her debut extended play (EP), Anyways, Life's Great in November, which entered the Billboard 200 at number 11. She won Best New Hip-Hop Artist at the 2022 BET Hip Hop Awards, and won in a similar category at the 2023 iHeartRadio Music Awards.

Her 2024 singles, "Yeah Glo!" and "Wanna Be" (with Megan Thee Stallion), both peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and preceded her debut commercial mixtape, Ehhthang Ehhthang (2024), which peaked at number 18 on the Billboard 200. Her third top-40 single of that year, "TGIF", preceded her debut studio album Glorious (2024), which peaked at number five.</p>
